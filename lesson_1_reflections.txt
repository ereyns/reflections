How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It did the job but still I needed to browse through the output to find the typo.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

If as a programmer I need to periodically report to someone , this would help a lot.


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Pros: under control and taken when really needed
Cons: One might forget.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Saving multiple files is needed because it concerns logical changes and logical changes in a development environment are likely to be spread over more than one file.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log gives a summary of all the commits on the repository while git diff compares two commits


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
Simply doing a commit will enable me to roll back to the point before making the changes.


Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
Donow.
